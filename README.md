## Blupay

### Origin
In my sophomore year, I participated in a business organization in which you were to come up with a business model/plan, and present it to mock venture capitalists. Blupay was designed to be a platform through which users without smartphones could still access the features of modern banking. Blupay 1.0 (which I wrote 2 years ago, also in PHP) was an interactive live demo in which my partners and I sent each other money over SMS, to show how fun the service was to use. 

While the demo and presentations were very successful, the original code was terribly written. As a result, I recently decided to re-write the project for fun, this time adding some more functionality and ease of use.

### Implementation Information
Blupay 2.0 continues to use the Twilio REST API in PHP. User data is stored in a mySQL database. The entire project is hosted live on my personal server.
